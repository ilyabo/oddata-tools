ODData-Tools
============

A set of utilities for working with Origin-Destination data. OD-data represent entitites flowing between pairs of geographical locations (e.g. flows of people, animals, money, material, or network traffic).

Here is a list of the tasks which are currently supported:

- Convert OD-data stored in CSV to GraphML
- Augment the geographical locations of OD-data with lat/lon coordinates (by querying geonames.org)
