oddata-tools provide a set of utilities for working with Origin-Destination data (i.e. data representing flows entitites between pairs of geographical locations, e.g. flows of people, animals, money, material, or network traffic).

Here is the list of currently supported tasks:
- Convert CSV to GraphML
- Augment the geographical locations with lat/lon coordinates (by querying geonames.org)
